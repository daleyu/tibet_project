              The Problem

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The context of this website is to build a resource to support the
              learning of the different locations for Columbia University's
              Course:

              When I was studying for the map quiz and trying to learn more
              about the locations, I found it difficult to quiz myself and learn
              the significance of each location in reference to each other. Many
              map quiz resources online lack exposure to Tibetan landmarks and
              features that you might have to find in textbooks or through
              online research.

                Specifically, many of the maps online don't even show the Tibet
                Autonomous Region as a separate entity from China.
              </li>
              <li>
                There is also little mention of the features within Tibet and
                distinction from the areas around it.
